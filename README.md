Vendor Performance Analytics System — Data Cleaning, Statistical Analysis & Interactive Dashboard

Built an end-to-end data analytics project to evaluate vendor and brand performance using a raw dataset of 20 million+ records, which I cleaned, transformed, and optimized into a structured dataset of 10,000+ high-quality rows. Performed extensive EDA to identify low-performing brands with high profit margins, top revenue-generating vendors, purchase-dollar contributions, and inventory risk indicators.

Implemented advanced statistical methods including t-tests, confidence interval estimation, and distribution analysis to compare profit margins between top and low-performing vendors. Created visual insights using Seaborn/Matplotlib, including Pareto charts, KDE distributions, boxplots, histograms with CIs, and vendor-level cost optimization patterns related to bulk purchasing.

Developed a fully interactive Streamlit dashboard to explore vendor performance, visualize KPIs, and assist decision makers in identifying pricing opportunities, inventory risks, and cost-saving procurement strategies. Integrated data workflows using MySQL, pandas, SQLAlchemy, scipy, and automated value labeling and CI shading techniques for clearer business insights.
